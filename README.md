# Podcast Player Service for Sonos

## Goal

The goal of this repository is to create a service that enables users to play podcasts on Sonos speakers and synchronize podcast subscriptions with popular podcast apps like AntennaPod. This service aims to enhance the podcast listening experience on Sonos systems by providing a seamless integration with podcast feeds, subscriptions, and playback control.

### Features

First, I want to build a backend that enables all of this:

- Sonos:
  - ☑ Play podcasts on Sonos speakers using a user-defined URL.
  - ☑ Device discovery.
- Podcasts
  - ☐ Sync podcast subscriptions with popular podcast apps (e.g., AntennaPod) for a unified podcast experience.
  - ☐ Control playback and manage podcast subscriptions through a user-friendly API.
  - ☐ Support for adding, updating, and deleting podcast subscriptions.

Based on that a UI with react or somethign similar will be developed.
